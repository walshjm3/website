I am a Ph.D. student in Business Economics at Harvard, where I am supported by the [NSF](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and [](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fopportunityinsights.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw25HI_wRsvNuIDcxFw_nmSR)[Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/).

I graduated from Harvard with an A.B. in Physics & Mathematics. Before starting my Ph.D., I was a management consultant at [Bain & Company](http://bain.com) and a research assistant at the [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/).

My research interests include public economics, industrial organization, and health policy.
